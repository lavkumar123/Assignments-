        "### **How Constraints Maintain Data Integrity**\n",

        "### **Common Types of Constraints and Examples**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`NOT NULL`**: Ensures a column cannot have a null value.  \n",
        "   Example:  \n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
        "       emp_id INTEGER NOT NULL\n",
        "   );\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   Use Case: Ensuring critical fields like `emp_id` are always provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`UNIQUE`**: Ensures all values in a column are distinct.  \n",

        "   CREATE TABLE users (\n",

        "   Use Case: Preventing duplicate user registrations with the same email.\n",

        "3. **`PRIMARY KEY`**: A combination of `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` that uniquely identifies each row in a table.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Mandatory Data**: Certain fields, such as `emp_id`, `email`, or `name`, are essential for the functionality of the application or the integrity of the database.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Data Validation**: It ensures that records are complete and consistent. For instance, an order without a `customer_id` would make it difficult to identify who placed the order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Preventing Logical Errors**: `NULL` values can complicate queries, especially in conditions or calculations. The `NOT NULL` constraint avoids these complexities.\n",

        "**No, a primary key cannot contain `NULL` values.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Justification**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Primary Key Definition**:\n",
        "   - A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.\n",
        "   - To ensure uniqueness, each row must have a value in the primary key column(s).\n",
        "   - `NULL` represents the absence of a value, which contradicts the concept of uniqueness and identification.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Uniqueness Violation**:\n",
        "   - In a table with a primary key, `NULL` values would lead to multiple rows being indistinguishable.\n",
        "   - Example:  \n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
        "         order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n",
        "     );\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     If `order_id` contains `NULL`, multiple rows could have the same `NULL`, violating uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Database Constraints**:\n",
        "   - Most relational databases enforce `NOT NULL` automatically on primary key columns. If you try to define a primary key with `NULL` values, the database will reject the operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Integrity**:\n",
        "   - Allowing `NULL` in a primary key would lead to incomplete data, breaking relationships in foreign key constraints.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**:\n",

        "3. **Impact on Data**:\n",
        "   - Adding a constraint can fail if existing data violates the constraint.\n",
